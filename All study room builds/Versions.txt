1.1 The quit button quits but the play button doesn't play
1.2 the quit button quits and the play button plays
1.3 The disappearing platforms reappear after 2 seconds
1.4 I made a trigger to instantiate the jump pad book platform at the very start and moved the 2nd checkpoint to the middle of the shelf so the player spawns correctly after they fall off
1.5 Changed the end to be on a very high shelf, added scripts to some of the books to add difficulty. Scripts are random for added surprise.
